# Transactions
A simple accounts-transactions setup.

As for any django project, to setup Transactions project we need to work at three fronts:
- OS level requirements
- python specific dependencies
- actual code base

1: OS level requirements:
At the OS level we need to take care of two things:
a> Libraries required: For this just run the following command in your terminal:
sudo apt-get install ..

b> Database setup: With the first step we have already installed postgres. Now we need to create the DB to be used by our django app.
